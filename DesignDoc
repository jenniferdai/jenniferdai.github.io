Also put watermark on cover photo!
Also get rid of that white rim around the picture in the browser...

1. Writing - though I can link Medium
Put a blurb about how I put introspective life advice there/personal day-to-day experiences. Since I am good with people/emotions/stuff like that.
Write about my travel experiences this past semester here on Medium! Before I forget.
2. Projects
3. Running. And other random athletic events that I participate in.(i.e: Dodgeball, Biking, Spartan)
What races I am looking forward to/what I have signed up for in the future.
Training for them/suggestions for people who are competing in these.
4. I obviously need more hobbies. Oh, actually pictures/photography? If people feel like looking at pretty things

The next few can go under "Things I'm passionate about."
5. List of best food recommendations here and there.
6. Maybe put my resume in there somewhere? Although that needs work as well.
7. Exercise/Nutrition Facts that I have collected, though that could go on Medium as well.
Maybe have an interactive section where you can search particular facts you think are relevant to you.
Like a true/false quiz that teaches you about nutrition when you take it? Or jeopardy type thing with facts. + sources
8. How I help women in CS - that is, after next semester.

Home page
I will keep the toolbar at the top by putting my code for the toolbar in all the sections.

Home - just returns to home page
about - pops up a fancybox
resume - also pops up a fancybox
projects - then it goes to a different page but keeps the toolbar
Running - also goes to different page but keeps the toolbar
Pictures on this page will pop up in a fancybox
TODO FOR BUTTONS: make the buttons collapse when hovered over.
