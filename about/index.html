        Hi! I'm Jennifer. I'm a fourth year CS Major at UC Berkeley. I love running and blogging on Medium. I'm constantly on a quest for self-improvement; my current challenge to myself is to learn how to draw and become more proficient at photography. I'm passionate about preventative medicine, empowering women in technology.
